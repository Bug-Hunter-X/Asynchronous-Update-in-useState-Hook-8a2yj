This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with React's useState hook: the asynchronous nature of updates.  The problem arises when trying to access the updated state value immediately after calling setState.  Because updates are asynchronous, logging the count inside the handleClick function will yield the *previous* state value, not the updated one.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this by using functional updates or the useEffect hook to ensure you are working with the latest state.
